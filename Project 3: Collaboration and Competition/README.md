In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores. This yields a single score for each episode. The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.

a README that describes how someone not familiar with this project should use your repository. The README should be designed for a general audience that may not be familiar with the Nanodegree program; you should describe the environment that you solved, along with how to install the requirements before running the code in your repository.
the code that you use for training the agent, along with the trained model weights.
a report describing your learning algorithm. This is where you will describe the details of your implementation, along with ideas for future work
